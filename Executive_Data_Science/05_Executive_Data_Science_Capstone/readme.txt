To Impute or not to Impute?

Decision: What date to use?
Do you want to impute the missing values in the dataset, build a prediction model that incorperates missing values, or do you only want to only user properties that have no missing data for any of their attributes?
データセットの欠損値を補完したり、欠損値を組み込む予測モデルを構築したり、属性の欠損データを持たないユーザープロパティのみにしたいですか？
1. Only use properties that have no missing data.
2. Buld a prediction model that incorperates whether or not the valiables are missing.
### 3. Impute the missing values.

Overfitting/Cross-validation

- Model Validation (Booz Allen Hamilton) (https://github.com/booz-allen-hamilton/The-Field-Guide-to-Data-Science/blob/master/LifeInTheTrenches-LessonsLearned/ModelValidation/ModelValidation.md)

What approach do you want to use controlling the possibility of over fitting when building the imputation model?

1. Use all of the data.
2. Partition the data into training and test and test sets to build the model.
### 3. Use cross validation to build the model.

Introducing the Variables

What are the implementations of using time as a variable in our price model?
時間を価格モデルの変数として使用する実装は何ですか

1. The value of a home could change over time even if nothing else about th home changed.
2. The value of a home shouldn't change over time especialy when nothng alse about the home changed. 
3. Time is likely a important predictor and therefore a model that accounts for time is  likely more accurate.
4. If time in an important predictor a model that inclides time will likely be less accurate.

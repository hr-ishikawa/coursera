## Welcome to the Executive Data Science Capstone!
Welcome to the capstone and congratulations on making it here! We've partnered with Zillow and DataCamp to create a unique managerial training experience which we hope that you'll enjoy. On DataCamp.com you'll be having meetings, sending and receiving emails, and making key decisions in the data analysis process, just like a data science manager at Zillow.

The capstone consists of a series of videos and multiple choice questions. Your grade will be calculated depending on your answers to the multiple choice questions. Make sure to read each question and each answer carefully and select the best answer to each question. Some (but not all) questions have multiple correct answers. Good luck with your new team at Zillow!

## Instructions
The Executive Data Science Capstone takes place completely on DataCamp.com. Navigate to the following assignment, verify your identity, and then click the blue "Open Tool" button to begin the capstone. After setting up DataCamp you will be presented with an email message from Chris, your new supervisor at Zillow. When you have completed the capstone please return to Coursera to verify that your grade has been recorded. The capstone should take between 1 and 2 hours to complete. Good luck at Zillow!
## Grading
You begin your capstone project with 100 points. Each decision you make along the way is an opportunity to preserve your point total, but points are deducted for every wrong choice. Some choices are more significant than others, making the deductions for some wrong choices more costly than others. We haven't indicated the point values in the exercise because part of your job is to understand which decisions are the most consequential.

Also, deductions for wrong choices are permanent within a given attempt. If you make a wrong decision and then change your mind because of feedback, you will not earn those points back within the attempt. Just like real life, consequential wrong choices can have a lasting effect.

When you reach the end, you will see your score for the attempt. If it is 70 or higher, you have passed. If your score is below 70, then you may attempt the exercise again. Each new attempt begins with a replenished supply of points.

## The Data Analysis Iteration

### Setting the Scene
### Epicycles of Analysis
There are 5 core activities of data analysis:
1. Stating and refining the question
2. Exploring the data
3. Building formal statistical models
4. Interpreting the results
5. Communicating the results
### Applying the Epicyle of Analysis Process
Before we discuss a couple of examples, let’s review the three steps to use for each core data analysis activity. These are :
1. Setting expectations,
2. Collecting information (data), comparing the data to your expectations, and if the expectations don’t match,
3. Revising your expectations or fixing the data so that your expectations and the data match.


## Six Types of Questions
Before we delve into stating the question, it's helpful to consider what the different types of questions are. There are six basic types of questions and much of the discussion that follows comes from a paper published in Science by myself and Jeff Leek. Understanding the type of question you are asking may be the most fundamental step you can take to ensure that, in the end, your interpretation of the results is correct. The six types of questions are:
1. Descriptive
2. Exploratory
3. Inferential
4. Predictive
5. Causal
6. Mechanistic

## Characteristics of a Good Question

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### Exploratory Data Analysis Checklist: A Case Study
In this section we will run through an informal "checklist" of things to do when embarking on an exploratory data analysis. As a running example I will use a dataset on hourly ozone levels in the United States for the year 2014. The elements of the checklist are
1. Formulate your question
2. Read in your data
3. Check the packaging
4. Look at the top and the bottom of your data
5. Check your "n"s
6. Validate with at least one external data source
7. Make a plot
8. Try the easy solution first
9. Follow up

## Interpretation of Results
There are several principles of interpreting results that we will illustrate in this lesson. These principles are:
1. Revisit your original question
2. Start with the primary statistical model to get your bearings and focus on the nature of the result rather than on a binary assessment of the result (e.g. statistically significant or not). The nature of the result includes three characteristics: its directionality, magnitude, and uncertainty. Uncertainty is an assessment of how likely the result was obtained by chance.
3. Develop an overall interpretation based on (a) the totality of your analysis and (b) the context of what is already known about the subject matter.
4. Consider the implications, which will guide you in determining what action(s), if any, sbould be taken as a result of the answer to your question.

## Communication
Focusing on a few core concepts will help you achieve your objectives when planning routine communication. These concepts are:

1. Audience: Know your audience and when you have control over who the audience is, select the right audience for the kind of feedback you are looking for.
2. Content: Be focused and concise, but provide sufficient information for the audience to understand the information you are presenting and question(s) you are asking.
3. Style: Avoid jargon. Unless you are communicating about a focused highly technical issue to a highly technical audience, it is best to use language and figures and tables that can be understood by a more general audience.
4. Attitude: Have an open, collaborative attitude so that you are ready to fully engage in a dialogue and so that your audience gets the message that your goal is not to "defend" your question or work, but rather to get their input so that you can do your best work.

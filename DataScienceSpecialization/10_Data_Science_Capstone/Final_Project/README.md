### Assinment

The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. For this project you must submit:

1. A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.
2. A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter (https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations) pitching your algorithm and app as if you were presenting to your boss or an investor.

## Review criteria

### Data Product

- Does the link lead to a Shiny app with a text input box that is running on shinyapps.io?
- Does the app load to the point where it can accept input?
- When you type a phrase in the input box do you get a prediction of a single word after pressing submit and/or a suitable delay for the model to compute the answer?
- Put five phrases drawn from Twitter or news articles in English leaving out the last word. Did it give a prediction for every one?

### Slide Deck

- Does the link lead to a 5 slide deck on R Pubs?
- Does the slide deck contain a description of the algorithm used to make the prediction?
- Does the slide deck describe the app, give instructions, and describe how it functions?
- How would you describe the experience of using this app?
- Does the app present a novel approach and/or is particularly well done?
- Would you hire this person for your own data science startup company?

この演習の目標は、作成した予測アルゴリズムを強調する製品を作成し、他のユーザーがアクセスできるインターフェイスを提供することです。このプロジェクトでは、次のものを提出する必要があります。

1. テキストボックス入力のフレーズ（複数の単語）を入力として受け取り、次の単語の予測を出力するShinyアプリ。
2. R Studio Presenter(https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations) で作成された5枚以下のスライドで構成されるスライドデッキ。上司や投資家にプレゼンテーションをしていました。

## Review criteria

### Data Product

- リンクは、shinyapps.ioで実行されているテキスト入力ボックスを備えたShinyアプリにつながりますか？
- アプリは、入力を受け入れることができるポイントまでロードしますか？
- 入力ボックスにフレーズを入力すると、submitを押した後に単一の単語の予測が得られますか、またはモデルが回答を計算するのに適した遅延がありますか？
- Twitterから引用した5つのフレーズまたは英語のニュース記事を最後の単語を除いて入れます。それはすべての人に予測を与えましたか？

Existing treatments for the disease include interferons, such as Avonex, which tamp down the immune system; Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) and Tysabri (natalizumab), which tamp down the immune system by different mechanisms. All are given as injections. Gilenya (fingolimod), the newest approved medication and the first oral drug for MS, reduces the number of lymphocytes in the blood.
The only outwardly religious adornment was a billboard-sized banner with an image of Our Lady of Charity, patron saint of Cuba, hanging on the side of the National Library.  
I get that different prism, in fact, sports narrative plays up the difference, even when the facts don't supportThe key to keeping your woman happy= attention, affection, treat her like a queen and sex her like a pornstar!

#### Does the link lead to a Shiny app with a text input box that is running on shinyapps.io ?
No, the link does not lead to a Shiny app with a text input box  
Yes, the link leads to a Shiny app with a text input box  

#### Does the app load to the point where it can accept input?
No, the app did not load or was not available to accept inputs  
Yes, the app could accept inputs.  

#### When you type a phrase in the input box do you get a prediction of a single word after pressing submit and/or a suitable delay for the model to compute the answer?
No, the app did not produce a prediction of a single word  
Yes, the app did produce a prediction of a single word  

####  Put five phrases drawn from Twitter or news articles in English leaving out the last word. Did it give a prediction for every one?

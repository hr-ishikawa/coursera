### AI pitfalls to avoid
```
Don't:                        Do:
------------------------------------
- Except AI to solve          - Be realistic about what AI can and
  Evrything                     cannot do given limitations of
                                technorogy, data, and  engneerring
                                resources

- Hire 2-3 ML engineers and   - Pair engineering talent with 
  count solely on them to       business talent and work cross-functionally
  come up with use cases        tofind feasible and valuable projects

- Except the AI priject to    - Plan for AI development to be an 
  work the first time           iterative process, with multiple
                                attempts needed to succeed

- Except traditional planning - Work with AI team to eatablish 
  processes to apply without    timeline estimantes, milestones,
  changes                       PKIs, etc
  
- Think you need superstar    - Keep building the team and get  
  AI engineers before you       going with a team you have
  can do anything
